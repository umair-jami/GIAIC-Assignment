# Frozen set
# immutable
# Hashable
# # It can be used as a key in a dictionary or an element of another set.
# unordered
# Unique elements

# In conclusion, sets and frozensets exhibit distinct characteristics while representing unordered collections of unique elements in Python. Sets offer mutability, allowing for dynamic modifications, while frozensets provide immutability, making them suitable for use as dictionary keys or elements within other sets. Understanding these fundamental data structures is essential for effective data manipulation and problem-solving in Python.
