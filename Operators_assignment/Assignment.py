#  Assignment Operators
# Used to assign values to variables.


# Operator	Example	Equivalent To
# =	x = 5	x = 5
# +=	x += 3	x = x + 3
# -=	x -= 3	x = x - 3
# *=	x *= 3	x = x * 3
# /=	x /= 3	x = x / 3
# //=	x //= 3	x = x // 3
x = 5
print("Assignment: x = 5                    ",x)  # Output: 5

x += 3  # Equivalent to x = x + 3
print("Addition Assignment: x += 3          ",x)  # Output: 8

x -= 3  # Equivalent to x = x - 3
print("Subtraction Assignment: x -= 3       ",x)  # Output: 5

x *= 3  # Equivalent to x = x * 3
print("Multiplication Assignment: x *= 3    ",x)  # Output: 15

x /= 3  # Equivalent to x = x / 3
print("Division Assignment: x /= 3          ",x)  # Output: 5.0

x //= 3  # Equivalent to x = x // 3
print("Floor Division Assignment: x //= 3   ",x)  # Output: 1.0
